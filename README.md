# Play-Fly-Power-BI-Dashboard
In this project, I designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and compare the performance of different teams.
Average of Ranks – Measuring consistency across various performance indicators.

Sum of Ranks – Evaluating overall team positioning against others

To enhance interactivity, I incorporated slicers that allow users to filter team data by different leagues , making the analysis flexible and insightful.

This project demonstrates how Power BI combined with DAX calculations can provide actionable insights for team comparisons, helping identify top performers and areas for improvement.
